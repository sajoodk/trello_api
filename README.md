Technologies

Instructions

- Clone this repo to your local machine.
- Trello API Key and Token are included in the script so that it runs out of the box.
- Open Trello (web) [https://trello.com/u/sajoodk/boards] or this invite for new members [https://trello.com/invite/userworkspace39805549/ATTIf19e2412d1abdba250b13c800515aa8d93883973] to see the execution.
- Run "trello_test.py" from the repo.
- "trello_test.py" has 4 test cases 
Testcase 1:Create Trello Board
Testcase 2: Create Card
Testcase 3: Delete Card
Testcase 4: Delete Board

Areas of Improvement:
- Leveraging the vast collection of trello api's and automate an end to end user flow instead of individual test scenarios.
- Handling negative scenarios/Error handling can be incorporated in the scripts[e.g.login failure].
- Selenium to validate my automation script :)
