Summary

Trello API Testcase to create board and card and delete them.

Technologies
Python

Instructions

- Clone this repo to your local machine.
- Trello API Key and Token are included in the script so that it runs out of the box.
- Login to trello and use this link to access my public workspace [https://trello.com/invite/userworkspace39805549/ATTIf19e2412d1abdba250b13c800515aa8d93883973] to see the execution.
Note: This step is optional, it is needed only if you want to see the UI during execution.
- Run "trello_test.py" from the repo.
- "trello_test.py" has 4 test cases 
Testcase 1:Create Trello Board
Testcase 2: Create Card
Testcase 3: Delete Card
Testcase 4: Delete Board

Areas of Improvement:
- Leveraging the vast collection of trello api's and automate an end to end user flow instead of individual test scenarios.
- Handling negative scenarios/Error handling can be incorporated in the scripts[e.g.login failure].
- Selenium to validate my automation script :)
